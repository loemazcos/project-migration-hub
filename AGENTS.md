- The game (src/components/GameApp.tsx) renders client-only from `/`; it is a browser phone simulator using a localStorage device id, so it must not run during SSR.
- All game persistence goes through one server function (`src/lib/game.functions.ts` → `src/server/*.server.ts`) using the admin client filtered by device id; tables have RLS with no client policies, so never read them from the browser.
